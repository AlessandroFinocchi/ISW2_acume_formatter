Once the results from ACUME has been obtained:
1. put all the result files .csv in the root directory,
    that's to say "ISW2_acume_formatter"
2. in main.py update the project_list variable with
    the list of result files imported in the root directory
3. run main.py: you will obtain the same files with "_final"
    appended in their name
